HOW TO INSTALL THE VISUAL STUDIO ADDIN

Copy AutoTest.VSAddin.AddIn to you Visual Studio user directory. Something like C:\Users\You\Documents\Visual Studio 20XX\Addins

Open the newly copied AutoTest.VSAddin.AddIn file and make the Assembly element point to where you unziped AutoTest.NET. If you're using Visual Studio 2010 change the HostApplication/Version to 10.

Open a visual studio command prompt and go to the folder containing the unzipped AutoTest.Net and write
	regasm.exe /CodeBase AutoTest.VSAddin.dll

When starting Visual Studio if you get the error message Unknown error 80131515 this means that windows has blocked your binaries. Rightclick and choose Unblock for each unpacked dll and exe file individually.

After Visual Studio has started make sure that the AutoTest.NET addin is enabled in Tools->Add-in Manager

You should be ready to go now. Open a solution, click Tools->AutoTest.NET and the feedback window should show up.
