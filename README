Geting started
To get started using this application edit AutoTest.config to suite your system.
When done start either the winforms app, the console app or the plugin (after you
have installed it). In the winforms application the little button in the top right
corner will display some nice to know messages now and then. When set up just edit
a file within the watched folder and save it. AutoTest.Net will detect any changes
and start builds and run tests.
If you end up in a scenario where it goes in to an endless loop it's probably
detecting changes in a file generated either by build or testrun. If so use the
ignore posibility in the configuration file. To figure out what files are being
generated turn on logging and check the debug.log file.

Installing the VS Addin
	Run Install_Visual_Studio_Addin.bat

Installing the VS Addin manually
	Copy AutoTest.VSAddin.AddIn to you Visual Studio user directory. Something like 
		C:\Users\You\Documents\Visual Studio 20XX\Addins
	Open the newly copied AutoTest.VSAddin.AddIn file and make the Assembly element
		point to where you unziped AutoTest.NET. If you're using Visual Studio 2010
		change the HostApplication/Version to 10.
	Open a visual studio command prompt and go to the folder containing the unzipped
		AutoTest.Net and write
		regasm.exe /CodeBase AutoTest.VSAddin.dll
	When starting Visual Studio if you get the error message Unknown error 80131515 
		this means that windows has blocked your binaries. Rightclick and choose Unblock 
		for each unpacked dll and exe file individually.
	After Visual Studio has started make sure that the AutoTest.NET addin is enabled 
		in Tools->Add-in Manager
	You should be ready to go now. Open a solution, click Tools->AutoTest.NET and the 
		feedback window should show up.

Quick usage
