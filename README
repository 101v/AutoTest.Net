Geting started
To get started using this application edit the configuration for the
runner you have decided to run (AutoTest.WinForms.exe.config /
AutoTest.Console.exe.config). When done start the application.

will display some nice to know messages now and then.
When set up just edit a file and save it. AutoTest.Net will detect
the changes and start builds and run tests.
