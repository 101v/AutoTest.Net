Geting started
To get started using this application edit AutoTest.config to suite your system.
When done start either the winforms app, the console app or the plugin (after you
have installed it). In the winforms application the little button in the top right
corner will display some nice to know messages now and then. When set up just edit
a file within the watched folderand save it. AutoTest.Net will detect any changes
and start builds and run tests.

Installing the VS Addin
Run Install_Visual_Studio_Addin.bat

Installing the VS Addin manually
Copy AutoTest.VSAddin.AddIn to you Visual Studio user directory. Something like C:\Users\You\Documents\Visual Studio 20XX\Addins

Open the newly copied AutoTest.VSAddin.AddIn file and make the Assembly element point to where you unziped AutoTest.NET. If you're using Visual Studio 2010 change the HostApplication/Version to 10.

Open a visual studio command prompt and go to the folder containing the unzipped AutoTest.Net and write
	regasm.exe /CodeBase AutoTest.VSAddin.dll

When starting Visual Studio if you get the error message Unknown error 80131515 this means that windows has blocked your binaries. Rightclick and choose Unblock for each unpacked dll and exe file individually.

After Visual Studio has started make sure that the AutoTest.NET addin is enabled in Tools->Add-in Manager

You should be ready to go now. Open a solution, click Tools->AutoTest.NET and the feedback window should show up.
